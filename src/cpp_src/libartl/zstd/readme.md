A single-file version of the [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) library is included with ARTL to facilitate static linking. A distribution-provided zstd package (e.g. libzstd-dev on Debian/Ubuntu) can be used instead; see the Makefile for details. Zstandard is dual-licensed under the BSD and GPL licences included here. The single-file version was produced using the `control/single_file_libs/combine.sh` script in the Zstandard repository.
